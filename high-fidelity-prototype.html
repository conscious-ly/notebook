    <h1>High-fidelity Prototype</h1>

    <h3>Design Evolution</h3>
    <p>During our low-fidelity (paper) prototype testing stage, we received some feedback on our design. Based on that, we made
    the following changes to our high fidelity (computer) prototype:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Moveable Widget</b></li> We received feedback saying that the Conscious.ly icon in the corner of the screen during an active session (i.e. while
      a task is in progress) is somewhat obstructive, and that we should move it into the task bar. We decided that something
      in the task bar may not be a present enough reminder and instead, we decided to make it so that the widget can be moved
      around the screen. This inspiration was taken from Facebook Messenger’s chathead bubble feature on Android devices.

      <li><b>Dynamic Settings</b></li> During our lo-fi prototype test, we did not have test subjects set their preferences (i.e. set which apps/websites they
      considered distracting). Instead, we told them to assume they had already done so; that it would be part of the
      installation of the app rather than an everyday function. Based on the subjects’ very valid feedback, we decided to make
      the settings dynamic; they can now be customized at any time. This allows change, but also covers the use case in which
      a user downloads a new application or finds a new distracting website after they have already installed and set up our
      app.

      <li><b>Positive Reinforcement</b></li> Some of our test subjects said that they would have liked some sort of reward or positive reinforcement for not getting
      distracted, such as a congratulatory message. We saw that as a low-effort, high-value feature, and have made it such
      that whenever a user selects “No” in response to the question “Are you sure you want to be distracted?” (which pops up
      when then open a distracting application/website), they get a short positive message of congrats.

      <li><b>Add Guilt & Difficulty</b></li> Almost all of our test subjects said that our “Are you sure you want to be distracted?” popup was too guilt-free and too
      easy to bypass, so we decided to add a second step if the user decides to answer “Yes”: they must solve a mental math
      question before they can access the distractive app/website. Note that we have currently only successfully implemented
      this in the desktop prototype; it is a work in progress for the mobile version.

    </ul>
    <h3>Prototype Implementation</h3>

    <p>For both desktop and mobile versions, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the <i>`README.md`</i> to get up and running.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b><i><a href="https://github.com/conscious-ly/desktop-client">Desktop Client:</a></i></b></li> Runs on all desktop environments, but only tested on Ubuntu. Browser support is also only limited to Chrome, and will likely remain so for the duration of the prototyping phase.

      <li><b><i><a href="https://github.com/conscious-ly/app">Mobile Client:</a></b></i></li> Runs only on Android; however can be emulated on a desktop.
    </ul>

    <p>Note that due to time constraints, support for session syncing across devices as suggested in the proposal is yet to be
    supported.</p>

    <h3>User Population</h3>

    <p>Conscious.ly’s user base will be primarily populated by individuals who are seeking to use their time more efficiently.
    In a modern society in which almost everything is immediately accessible, people have become increasingly distracted.
    These distractions lead people away from the goals they set out to accomplish and can prevent them from achieving
    distinction in their given task. For those individuals who seek to find a more fulfilling use of their time but are
    easily distracted, Concious.ly provides a platform through which they will be encouraged to stay on track and accomplish
    their goals. However, if they do choose to deviate from their goals and be distracted, they will be required to
    explicitly admit to doing so, making it a conscious decision rather than something they can “unknowingly” fall victim
    to.</p>

    <p>In our Project Proposal, we described and named five user groups who may benefit from the app. Here, we narrow it down,
    creating a new list of user populations with which we wish high-fidelity prototype testing to be carried out.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>For those individuals that fall under our Social Butterfly moniker, Conscious.ly provides an outlet in which they will
      have to go through steps in order to deviate from the work at hand. This will more accurately put in perspective the
      costs and benefits of talking to friends as opposed to working productively.</li>
      <li>While an individual who falls under the tag of Utilitarian may use the extraneous functions of their devices
      infrequently, they often seek out systems which promote productivity. Our app not only allows them to exercise
      willpower, but also backs up their lifestyle choices, further protecting them from harmful distractions.</li>
      <li>The people who fall under our Relaxed persona generally enjoy spending their time frivolously on various online
      activities. Given feedback from some of our lo-fi prototype test subjects, most of the Relaxed individuals want to use
      their time more effectively, but are often unable to due to the prevalent distractions at their fingertips. These
      individuals will be able to use Conscious.ly to deviate from the distractions that govern their life and allow them to
      prosper in activities that are required of them.</li>
      <li>Those individuals that we called Multi-Taskers will find our app extremely useful, because it will allow them to become
      better at focusing on a single task at any given time. It is proven that trying to accomplish multiple tasks at once is
      highly inefficient, therefore improving this skill will not only help them overcome their frenzied nature, but also help
      them become more effective at each task they complete.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Originally, we had a fifth type of user (the Goal-Orientated). Upon further examination, we realised that since this
    user group rarely deviates from the goal at hand, their distractions are limited. While this group is more than welcome
    to enjoy the use of Conscious.ly, they are not the target audience segment, and instead are the group that Conscious.ly
    will help its other users merge into.</p>

    <h3>Usability Goals & Reporting</h3>

    <p>Below are the usability goals we aim to test, which can be measured and given a score of either 1, 2, or 3. Use the Data
    Collection google form link above to record data both during the test (goals 1 and 2) and after it has been completed
    (goals 3 and 4). Once all the data has been recorded, Google provides reports that allow you to see each question’s
    results per user and also as a summary of all users. As the design team, you are expected to look for particular
    interest points or patterns in these results, and decide how complicated certain features were and how useful the app is
    overall.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The user should be able to operate the app effectively with minimalistic instructions:
        <ul>
          <li>As soon as the test begins, ask the users the following tasks, and count the number of times a user asks instructions
          during each of them. Give them a score (for each) as described below:</li>

          <p>(1 = No user instructions required)</p>
          <p>(2 = One hint required)</p>
          <p>(3 = More than one hint or full set of instructions required)</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Ask the user to start a task for 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Ask the user to set preferences (i.e. outline their typical distractions) using the app</li>
            <li>Ask the user to check how much time they have remaining without leaving their work</li>

            <p>-------Test next usability goal before asking them to perform the task below-------</p>

            <li>Ask the user to exit the app when the time is up</li>
          </ul>

        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        The system should curb ineffective time management
        <ul>
          <li>
            Let the user use the app without direction until the set 10 minutes are up (i.e. do not ask them to do anything during
            this time)
          </li>

          <p>(1 = The user is solely focused on the task at hand for the 10 minutes)</p>
          <p>(2 = The user is somewhat distracted in the 10 minutes (0-4 minutes))</p>
          <p>(3 = The user is completely distracted in the first 10 minutes (4+ minutes))</p>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        The system should lack intrusion
        <ul>
          <li>Post test, ask the user how distracting they felt the app was</li>

          <p>(1 = The user feels as though the app does not serve as a distraction)</p>
          <p>(2 = The user feels that the app, while having a positive focus, sometimes causes further distraction)</p>
          <p>(3 = The user feels that the app is disruptive, restricting their ability to accomplish work)</p>

        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        The system should satisfy the user and accrue long term clientele
        <ul>
          <li>Post test, ask the user how often they would use the app, if at all</li>

          <p>(1 = The user will use the application in everyday life and feels it will allow them to be more productive)</p>
          <p>(2 = The user will use the application only on certain days with high work volume but doesn’t appreciate its value
          constantly)</p>
          <p>(3 = The user finds the application to be redundant or lacking in value; will not be returning to the app in the future)</p>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Usability Evaluation</h3>

    <p>The following are the usability evaluation criteria that will be assesed, in order of importance:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>User Control and Freedom</b></li>
      <p>(3) - The user feels completely at ease using the system</p>
      <p>(2) - The user feels a bit constrained while using the system</p>
      <p>(1) - The user feels very constrained while using the system</p>

      <li><b>Aesthetic and Minimalistic Design</b></li>
      <p>(3) - The user finds the design appealing and unobstructive</p>
      <p>(2) - The user finds the design somewhat appealing and unobstructive</p>
      <p>(1) - The user finds the design unappealing and obstructive</p>

      <li><b>Visibility of System Status</b></li>
      <p>(3) - The system staus is always transparent to the user</p>
      <p>(2) - The system status is sometimes transparent to the user</p>
      <p>(1) - The system status is obscured</p>
